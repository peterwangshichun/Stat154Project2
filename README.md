## Data Collection and Exploration

We imported and explored the data first to get a idea of the data structure. Then, we used ggplot2 to plot the distribution of the points corresponding to different images, as well as the boxplots between different features. In addition, we used corrplot to generate the correlogram, analyzing the relationships of different features.
